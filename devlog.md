# Week 1 (06.02.2024)

Worked on the chapter 2 random number generator.

Take note of `cargo doc --open`, will come in handy.

Learned about the basic of Rust - how to use the match statement, and how to sort
of employ an enum in the way of `cmp`. Learned a way to inference a data type as a
different one, and used a loop.
